# Build-it-Bigger: Android Developer Nanodegree 

The Build it Bigger application is the final project in the Gradle lessons of the Android Developer Nanodegree program.
The finished app consists of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.
